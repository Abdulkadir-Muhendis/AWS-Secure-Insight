### AWS-IoT-Zero-Touch
#### AWS JIT and Bring your Own Certificate Demo.

### Introduction
[AWS IoT](http://aws.amazon.com/iot/) is a service that will allow internet of things (IoT) devices to be easily and securely connected to Amazon Web Services (AWS).  The Microchip __AWS-IoT-Zero-Touch__ solution provides the following key features:

1. Secure the communication of any AWS IoT node regardless of the Microcontroller or Processor used
2. Accelerate the cryptographic algorithms of the TLS (Transport Layer Security) layer and secure them in a Trusted Execution Environment
3. Remove all need to manipulate or generate keys and certificates. Essentially makes the manufacturing of AWS IoT end nodes "Zero Touch" from a security viewpoint.

Currently this demo is designed to work with the following demos:
- [Microchip AWS IoT Zero Touch](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/aws-iot-firmware-pic32mz)
